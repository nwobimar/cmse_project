# cmse_project
This repository contains the data we used, a .py file to contain our data manipulation, and a final project notebook.
The .py is meant to be ran all the way through first. This will ensure that all of the data used in the final notebook is pulled from the .py file correctly.
The final notebook is meant to be ran once, all the way through to ensure the desired results. This will make sure that the calculations and modeling is consistent throughout the notebook.
Each member of our group contributed to this project by doing data manipulation that was split up amongst us. Asher did the years 2013 and 2014, Aryan did 2015 and 2016, Marius did 2017 and 2018, and Ryan did 2019 and 2021.
We all collaborated on the final notebook through zoom meetings to work through our issues and create our final project.
